## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

On this project, I revisited some of the least used FlexBox's properties by me, such as `order` or `justify-concent: flex-end`; and I think that was a good way to have this knowledge fresh enough. I first thought I was going to need CSS Grid to accomplish it, but after a few tries I was able to came up with a good solution using FlexBox.

### Continued development

I think things are going very well, I just need to continue practicing and make myself sure of doing it the best way i can.

### Useful resources

- [CSS Flexbox - w3schools.com](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_flexbox.asp) - This helped me to refresh some FlexBox concepts and properties I used on this project.
